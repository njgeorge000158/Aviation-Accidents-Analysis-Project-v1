Project 3 Repository for the UPenn Data Science Bootcamp. Team members: Jackie Ochuida, Nicholas George, Rajib Maji, Arame Diasse, Theresa Bravo, Vishnu Pillai, Stephen Grantham. 
## Project Overview<brs>
Our objective was to extract and clean 50 years of aviation crash data in order to compare historical trends and create maps of aviation accident with user-friendly interactivities allowing viewers to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.

We employed D3, JSON, Javascript, Plotly, Leaflet, SQLite, Flask, Jupyter Notebook, and JQuery. Our final visualizations are presented on a landing page made with HTML.<br>

Visualizations presented:<br> 
<ol>
    <li>Heatmap of Plane Crash Locations over 50 years</li>
    <li>Bubble Chart of Fatalities per Crash Site</li>
    <li>Plotly Bar Graph of Crashes per Year</li>
</ol>
