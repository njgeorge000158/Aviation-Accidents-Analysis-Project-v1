    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Air travel stands as an undeniable revolution in the transportation sector, delivering a multitude of invaluable advantages. These include unprecedented speed, unparalleled global connectivity, and a continuous drive for innovation. Nevertheless, the aviation industry encounters its fair share of challenges and predicaments, with a primary focus on safety. In the pages that follow, we delve into the intricate tapestry of aviation safety, exploring how it varies among different countries, aircraft types, and operators.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project involves a comprehensive analysis of plane crash data collected over 50 years from 1973 to 2023. We employed D3, JSON, JS, Plotly, and JQuery. We aimed to create an informative representation of historical plane crash data which could allow stakeholders to uncover patterns, trends, and insight.</p>
    <h4 style="font-family:Helvetica;">Questions to be considered:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Can we accurately predict where plane crashes are likely to occur?</li>
      <li>Are there certain airlines that have more crashes than others?</li>
      <li>Are there possible outside factors affecting these trends?</li>
    </ol>

  <h4> Historical Context</h4>
  <h5 style="font-weight: normal; font-family: 'Arial'"> In 1783,the Montgolfier brothers launched the first flight using a hot air balloon.the early 20th century that the Wright Brothers achieved the first powered, controlled, and sustained flight with their aircraft, the Wright Flyer.As aviation technology advanced, commercial aviation took off in the 1920s and 1930s.The 1950s brought the Jet Age, with the introduction of commercial jet airliners like the Boeing 707.In the 21st century, aviation continues to evolve, with a focus on sustainability, fuel efficiency, and exciting new frontiers, such as electric aviation and space exploration.  </h5>
