    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Air travel stands as an undeniable revolution in the transportation sector, delivering a multitude of invaluable advantages. These include unprecedented speed, unparalleled global connectivity, and a continuous drive for innovation. Nevertheless, the aviation industry encounters its fair share of challenges and predicaments, with a primary focus on safety. In the pages that follow, we delve into the intricate tapestry of aviation safety, exploring how it varies among different countries, aircraft types, and operators.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project involves a comprehensive analysis of plane crash data collected over 50 years from 1973 to 2023. We employed D3, JSON, JS, Plotly, and JQuery. We aimed to create an informative representation of historical plane crash data which could allow stakeholders to uncover patterns, trends, and insight.</p>
    <h4 style="font-family:Helvetica;">Questions to be considered:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Can we accurately predict where plane crashes are likely to occur?</li>
      <li>Are there certain airlines that have more crashes than others?</li>
      <li>Are there possible outside factors affecting these trends?</li>
    </ol>
